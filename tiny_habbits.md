In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting part of the video, for me, is that to achieve a goal, you should focus on developing the right behavior and break it down into tiny, manageable habits. These small steps build momentum and make reaching your goal more achievable.

### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### Answer

To make adopting new habits easier using the B = MAP formula, focus on three key factors: Motivation, Ability, and Prompt. Motivation involves understanding and reinforcing why the habit is important to you, Ability means simplifying the behavior to make it easier to perform, and Prompt refers to using clear cues to remind you to carry out the habit. By enhancing motivation, reducing the effort required, and setting up effective reminders, you can increase the likelihood of successfully integrating new habits into your routine.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

### Answer

Celebrating each successful completion of a habit is essential because it creates a positive association with the behavior, reinforcing the habit and boosting motivation. By acknowledging and rewarding yourself, you build a positive feedback loop that makes the habit more enjoyable and encourages consistency. This "Shining" process helps solidify the habit and increases the likelihood of it becoming a regular part of your routine.

### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Answer

In the video "1% Better Every Day," the most compelling idea is the notion that our habits, whether good or bad, have a profound impact on our lives. A good habit can become our strongest ally, propelling us toward success and fulfillment through consistent, positive actions. On the other hand, a bad habit can be our worst enemy, gradually eroding our progress and holding us back from reaching our full potential. This duality underscores the importance of consciously cultivating good habits and being vigilant against the influence of bad ones.

### Question 5
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

### Answer


In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes the importance of aligning your habits with your identity, arguing that lasting change comes from focusing on who you want to become rather than just what you want to achieve. Instead of starting with goals, Clear suggests beginning with the type of person you identify as; for instance, rather than aiming to lose weight, think of yourself as a healthy person. By consistently acting in ways that reinforce this identity, your habits naturally align, making behavior change more sustainable and less effortful.

### Question 6
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

### Answer

In Atomic Habits, James Clear explains that making habits easier involves reducing friction and simplifying the behavior. He suggests using the "Two-Minute Rule" to start habits by making them so simple they take just two minutes, ensuring consistency. Clear also highlights the importance of designing your environment to support good habits and reduce distractions, using habit stacking to link new habits to existing routines, and removing small barriers that make a habit harder to perform. These strategies help make desired behaviors more automatic and sustainable.

### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

### Answer

In Atomic Habits, James Clear explains that making a habit harder to do involves increasing the friction or obstacles associated with the undesired behavior. By adding more steps or creating inconveniences, you can make the habit less appealing and more difficult to carry out. For example, if you want to reduce screen time, you might place your phone in another room or use an app that locks it for certain periods. The idea is to design your environment in a way that puts barriers in the path of bad habits, making them less automatic and harder to maintain.

## 5. Reflection:

### Question 8:
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

### Answer


One habit I’d like to do more of is regular reading. To make this habit stick, I’ll place the book in a visible spot, like my bedside table, as a cue. I'll choose books that interest me and pair reading with a reward, like a cup of tea. I’ll start with just 5 minutes a day to make it easy and track my progress to make the habit satisfying.

### Question 9:
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

### Answer

I’d like to reduce my social media use. To do this, I’ll make the cue invisible by turning off notifications and moving the apps to a less accessible screen. I’ll make the process unattractive by setting app usage limits and using apps that block access after a certain time. Finally, I’ll make the response unsatisfying by tracking my usage and noting any negative impacts on my productivity, which will reinforce the desire to cut down.
