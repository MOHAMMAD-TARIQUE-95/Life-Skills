### Question 1
What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

### Answer
The Feynman Technique helps you learn faster by simplifying a concept into its basic terms, identifying gaps in your understanding, and refining your explanation until you can teach it clearly and concisely to a person with zero knowledge about the concept.

### Question 2
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

### Answer
The most interesting part of the video, in my opinion, is how we can change our approach to learning new concepts or ideas and make space for new knowledge, which is often a challenging process. Barbara Oakley beautifully explains a technique that allows us to effectively learn something new by being not only focused but also relaxed, as the brain’s relaxed mode enables us to see the bigger picture of a problem.

### Question 3
What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

### Answer
Active and diffused modes of thinking are two complementary mental states that our brains use to process information and solve problems. The active mode, also known as focused mode, is characterized by intense concentration and analytical thinking. In this mode, you engage deeply with a specific task, working through problems step by step and focusing on details. This mode is essential for tasks that require precision, such as studying, solving complex problems, or writing.

On the other hand, the diffused mode, or relaxed mode, is a more open and creative state of mind. In this mode, your brain is not focused on a single task but instead allows thoughts to flow freely, making broader connections between ideas. This mode is particularly useful for creativity and problem-solving, as it helps you see the "big picture" and come up with new solutions or ideas. Effective learning often involves alternating between these two modes—focusing intensely on a problem and then relaxing to allow your brain to make new connections and insights.

### Question 4
According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

### Answer
- Deconstruct the new topic into smaller topics and master them.
- Learn enough to self correct
- Remove practice barriers
- Practice the topic atleast 20 hours.

### Question 5
What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

### Answer
- Using the Feynman Technique, we can master concepts by simplifying them into easy-to-understand terms.
- Identifying gaps in knowledge, and refining the explanation until we can teach it clearly.
- To enhance learning, we can alternate between focused mode and relaxed mode, allowing us to deeply engage with a topic.
- We can take a step back to gain a broader perspective, thereby improving our overall grasp of the subject.
- To learn or master a topic or skill, we can deconstruct it into smaller components and focus on mastering each piece.
- We should aim to learn enough to be able to self-correct.
- Focus on overcoming learning barriers.
- Practice the skill for at least 20 hours.
