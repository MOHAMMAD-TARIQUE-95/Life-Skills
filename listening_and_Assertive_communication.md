#### Question 5
When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

#### Answer

You might switch to a passive communication style to avoid conflict, when lacking confidence, to please others, or when feeling overwhelmed, especially in situations involving authority or expertise. This often involves not asserting your own views and accommodating others instead.

#### Question 6
When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

#### Answer

You might switch to an aggressive communication style when you're feeling frustrated, want to assert dominance, or feel strongly about defending your position. This style often emerges in high-stress situations, when you're trying to control a conversation, or when you perceive a threat to your needs or values. It can also occur when you feel your boundaries are being violated or when you want to express strong dissatisfaction or anger.

#### Question 7
When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

#### Answer

You might use passive-aggressive communication when you're unhappy but don’t want to say it directly. This can include being sarcastic, gossiping about others, making taunting remarks, or giving someone the silent treatment. It’s a way of showing your frustration indirectly instead of addressing it openly.

#### Question 8
How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

#### Answer 

To communicate assertively, we can be clear and direct about what you need or feel, using "I" statements like "I need more time" rather than making hints. We can use open body language, such as eye contact and a steady voice, to show confidence.

Also, listen carefully to the other person and respond respectfully, even if you disagree. Set clear boundaries about what you can handle and be honest about your limits. This helps you express yourself well while maintaining good relationships.
