# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

Please go through the given resources and try to answer the following 2 questions concisely.

## Questions:

* What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

## Answer

Sexual harassment involves a range of behaviors, including unwelcome sexual advances, inappropriate comments, sexual jokes, or propositions. Non-verbal actions like staring, displaying explicit materials, or making suggestive gestures, as well as physical behaviors such as unwanted touching or blocking someone's path, also constitute harassment. It can occur in person or online, with cyber harassment including sending explicit content or unwanted sexual messages. These behaviors create a hostile or intimidating environment, making the victim feel uncomfortable or threatened.

* What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

## Answer


If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would document the incident with details like dates and witnesses, and if safe, I might directly confront the behavior to make it clear it’s unacceptable. I would report it to the appropriate authority, such as HR or a supervisor, and offer support to the victim if I’m a witness. Additionally, I would seek professional advice or counseling if needed and prioritize my safety by removing myself from dangerous situations or contacting law enforcement if necessary.
