# Energy Management

## 1. Manage Energy not Time

The image below lists the four emotional quadrants:

* Excitement
* Stress
* Depression
* Calm

[Emotional Quadrant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335191634/figure/fig2/AS:792212367486976@1565889555183/Modified-PA-plane-with-four-emotional-quadrants.jpg)

The idea is to remain in the Excitement, Stress and Calm quadrants for a more happy, calm and engaging life.

Stress is an inevitable part of life. We get stressed whether learning something new or doing an intense workout. Stress helps us to grow. But staying stressed too long can cause a burnout or make us anxious and depressed.

One of the ways to be less stressful is 'Feeling the stress and completing the task'. This improves our skill level and we will feel less stress in the future.

If we welcome stress with the right mindset and then switch to activities in Calm quadrant to relax and recover, we can get the best out of life.

We will discuss this central idea in this session.

Understanding your own self is a crucial part of the whole process.

### Question 1:
What are the activities you do that make you relax - Calm quadrant?

### Answer

Activities in the Calm Quadrant focus on relaxation and inner peace, such as meditation, mindfulness, nature walks, and yoga, which help reduce stress and promote mental clarity. Creative hobbies like painting or journaling, along with reading and listening to calming music, provide an escape from daily pressures. Practices like deep breathing exercises and light stretching also aid in calming both the body and mind, allowing you to unwind and recharge effectively. These activities foster mindfulness and relaxation, creating a sense of balance and tranquility.

### Question 2:
When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?

### Answer

The Stress Quadrant is entered when overwhelming demands or tight deadlines create pressure. It often arises from heavy workloads, uncertainty, or managing multiple tasks without breaks. Stress occurs when situations feel out of control or lack clarity and support.

### Question 3:
How do you understand if you are in the Excitement quadrant?

### Answer

You know you're in the Excitement Quadrant when you feel energized, motivated, and deeply engaged in what you're doing. There's a sense of anticipation or thrill, often accompanied by enthusiasm and a positive challenge that pushes your abilities without overwhelming you. Itâ€™s marked by high focus, creativity, and a drive to achieve, where the tasks feel enjoyable and fulfilling rather than stressful.

## 2. Understanding Energy Sources

Focusing on energy sources provide a solid foundation to remain in the **Excitement** and **Calm** quadrants.

### Physical Energy Sources
1. Ether
  - Physical Rest - sleep, nap or lying down

  - Staying hydrated
5. Earth
  - We consume electrons from earth. This makes our charge neutral. Without this the body is slightly positive in charge.
  - Barefoot exposure to earth for at least 1 hour a day

2. Conversations
3. Laughter
