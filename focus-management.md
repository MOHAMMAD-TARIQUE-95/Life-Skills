## 6. Intentionally creating diffused mode in your life

Giving brain time and space to experience diffused mode helps it gain the rest, relaxation and break required for active mode.

Some of the activities that can help it:
* meditation
* walking without digital distractions
* standing in silence
* sitting in silence
* lying down in silence or Shavasana
* doing physical chores with concentration like cleaning or washing dishes

## 7. Getting started on difficult tasks

Sometimes we found ourselves procrastinating on some tasks. Procrastination is generally because we are avoiding a particular emotion like fear, boredom or frustration.

There is a common method to deal with procrastination. People call it by different names. Names include 'one step at a time' or 'action precedes motivation' or 'shifting your identity' or 'creating undeniable stack of proofs'.

Let's take an example.

There is a programming task and you are afraid you don't know how to do it. That fear is not letting you start on the project.

1. Step 1: Work only for 30 seconds on the task.
2. Step 2: Take a break.
3. Step 3: Remind yourself you are capable of doing the task. This task is scary but I am capable of completing the task.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3. You can gradually increase time in step 1.

Similarly let's say you have to check a lot of data and prepare a report. The task is boring and you don't want to get started on it.

1. Step 1: Work only for 30 seconds on the task.
2. Step 2: Take a break.
3. Step 3: Remind yourself you are capable of doing the task. This task is boring but I can handle it and finish it.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3. You can gradually increase time in step 1.

Our brain likes proof and uses that proof to build confidence. You can use this technique to build evidence in your ability and shift your identity.
