#### Question 1
Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines. Use your own words.

#### Answer 

Success and happiness in life are not determined by a high IQ, but rather by grit which is a combination of passion and perseverance over long periods. Grit is not positively correlated with IQ; in fact, if there is any relation, it tends to be inverse. This means that while intelligence may play a role, it is grit that truly drives long-term success and fulfillment.
